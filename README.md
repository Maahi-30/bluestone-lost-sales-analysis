# Bluestone Lost Sales Analysis | Data Analytics Internship Project

This project was completed as part of my **Data Analytics Internship at Bluestone** (May’25–June’25).
The goal was to analyze lost sales data and uncover actionable insights to reduce missed revenue opportunities in retail jewelry sales.

---

## Objective

The project focused on analyzing 300+ lost sales records across Bluestone stores to:

- Identify the most demanded but unavailable jewelry products.
- Segment store performance across key variables like item category, design type, and price range.
- Recommend data-driven improvements for inventory and assortment planning.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas)** – Data cleaning and transformation
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – Exploratory visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis documentation and code execution
- **Excel** – Source data file

## Key Deliverables

- Cleaned and transformed the raw dataset by removing irrelevant fields and formatting columns.
- Segmented **10+ retail stores** by item category, price range, and design sub-category.
- Flagged:
  - **5 top-performing stores** (e.g., Wave One, Noida; OMR, Chennai)
  - **3 underperforming stores** (e.g., Centrio Mall, Dehradun)
- Identified **top 10 high-demand product combinations** based on customer interest and missed conversions.
- Mapped demand gaps across stores to improve inventory and product availability.

## Business Insights

- **Inventory Gap**: Popular products were missing in stores with untapped potential.
- **Category-Design Synergy**: Certain combinations drove most customer interest.
- **Store-Level Optimization**: Data pointed to specific stores that could benefit from reallocation of stock.
- **Price Range Patterns**: Different locations showed distinct preferences for pricing brackets.

## Conclusion

This project delivered real-world, data-backed insights to optimize Bluestone’s inventory distribution, product planning, and store-level decision-making. It reflects the impact of applied data analytics in a retail business context.
